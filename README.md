 Hello there ðŸ‘‹,
 
I graduated in Economics and I love financial markets. I started to get interested in programming through use of quantitative models applied to investments and since then I haven't stopped...
I currently use python in my daily work looking for insights to support my decisions with focus on machine learning and quantitative models.


<h3> Interests ðŸ‘€ </h3> 
Python <br>
Data Analysis <br>
Machine Learning <br>
Finance Models <br>
Virtual Reality <br>
